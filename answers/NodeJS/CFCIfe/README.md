# How to run code file in nodejs

Readline package messes up in node repl so you need to run the files instead.

- navigate to the folder [CFCIFE](../CFCIFE) on your terminal

To get a shorter file names in your terminal before opening node, run
`$ dir /x`

- Run `$ npm install` to install all packages

- Open node repl
  `$ node`

- All functions have been exported already. (Check the codes to know how to do that)

- run
  `$ const <variable> = require('./name-of-file')`

- run
  `$ variable()`

Repeat for all the files.

Code explanation will be updated in due time. But most are very plain readable javascript syntax.
