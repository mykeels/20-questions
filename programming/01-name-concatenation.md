# Name Concatenation

Request the user's first name, last name and age.

Print out `Welcome, <First-Name> <Last-Name> (<Age>)` in a new line.

## Variants

1. Print out `Welcome, <First-Name> <Last-Name> (<Year-Of-Birth>)`, where `Year-of-Birth` is derived as `Age` subtracted from `Current-Year`.

2. Request the user's gender.

   Print out `Welcome, <First-Name> [Son/Daughter] of <Last-Name> (<Year-Of-Birth>)`, where `Son` is printed out if `male`, and `Daughter` if `female`.

## Things to Consider (Extras)

1. When receiving age input, to be used in an arithmetic operation, you'll want to make sure it's a number.

2. When dealing with making decisions based off text, be mindful of cases. A user might enter `Female` as their gender, which is equivalent to `female`, and same as `FEMALE`.
