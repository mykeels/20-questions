# Background

Let's say we have a table `products`:

| id | name | price | category | created_at | updated_at | deleted_at |
|----|------|-------|----------|------------|------------|------------|
| 1  | A    | 10    | X        | 2020-01-01 | 2020-01-01 | NULL       |
| 2  | B    | 20    | Y        | 2020-01-02 | 2020-01-02 | NULL       |
| 3  | C    | 30    | X        | 2020-01-03 | 2020-01-03 | NULL       |
| 4  | D    | 40    | Y        | 2020-01-04 | 2020-01-04 | NULL       |
| 5  | E    | 50    | X        | 2020-01-05 | 2020-01-05 | NULL       |

## Question: Create a Derived Column

Write a query to add a new derived column `price_bucket` to the `products` table. The `price_bucket` should be `Low` if the price is less than or equal to 10, `Medium` if the price is between 10 and 30, and `High` if the price is greater than 30.

## Variants

1. (Advanced) Using the average and standard deviation, create a new derived column `price_bucket` to the `products` table. The `price_bucket` should be: 
- `Low` if the price is less than the average, 
- `Medium` if the price is between the average and the average + one standard deviation, 
- `High` if the price is greater than the average plus one standard deviation.
